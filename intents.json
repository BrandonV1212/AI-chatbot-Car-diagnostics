    "responses": ["White or Grey Smoke: White smoke indicates that the coolant is being combusted along with the fuel and there is a leakage somewhere in the Engine block, cylinder head and head gasket.  Blue Smoke: Blue smoke indicates that there is a leakage in the valve seals or guides or the piston rings have worn out, which are causing the engine oil to penetrate into the combustion chamber which is causing the oil to burn along with the fuel. Hence Causing Blue Smoke.  Black Smoke: This means that excessive fuel is being burnt in the combustion chambers due to a leak in the fuel injector, a stuck fuel pressure regulator or a restriction in the fuel combustion pipe. This usually happens with relatively older cars and in such situations, it is very crucial to get the leaks checked from a specialised mechanic."]
